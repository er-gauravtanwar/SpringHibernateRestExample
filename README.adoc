== Create the database

Go to the terminal (command Prompt `cmd` in Microsoft Windows). Open MySQL client with a user that can create new users.

For example: On a Linux, use the command

[source, sh]
----
$ sudo mysql --password
----

NOTE: This connects to MySQL as a root, this is *not the recommended way* for a production server.

Create a new database

[source, mysql]
----
mysql> create database db_example; -- Create the new database
mysql> create user 'springuser'@'localhost' identified by 'ThePassword'; -- Creates the user
mysql> grant all on db_example.* to 'springuser'@'localhost'; -- Gives all the privileges to the new user on the newly created database
----
